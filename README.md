# WebRTC-Demos

These are just my experiments with using WebRTC with other HTML5 technologies. The intention is to see whats possible in WebRTC from the front-end perspective. 

## Running the demos

Just clone the repo and run it on a local server. Make sure you have a WebRTC capable browser (preferebly the latest version). If you have the *developer* stream of the browser (Like Chrome Canary, Opera Developer, or Firefox Aurora) then thats even better.

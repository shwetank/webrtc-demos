# WebRTC-Demos

These are just my experiments with using WebRTC with other HTML5 technologies. The intention is to see whats possible in WebRTC from the front-end perspective. 

## Running the demos

Just clone the repo and run it on a local server. Make sure you have a WebRTC capable browser (preferebly the latest version). If you have the *developer* stream of the browser (Like Chrome Canary, Opera Developer, or Firefox Aurora) then thats even better. 

## gUM with CSS
This demo basically explores how you can use various things like CSS filters, blend modes and CSS Masks to achieve fun effects with real-time video. 

## Super Simple Video Chat
This demo uses a simple node server for signalling, and establishes a basic video chat (data channels too, but nothing beyond just establishing a connection). This is just to make the simplest possible demo of a very simple video chat application using webrtc.
